# openJohnny

The goal of this project is to create an accurate set of models for printing a mini Johnny 5 from the short circuit movies. Currently aiming at resin printers.

Its based on a number of existing models used as reference, and wouldnt be possible without this https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4659508, which I believe used Sergey Khramov's excellent model as a starting point.
It also contains parts of the Johnny 5 cad from https://input-inc.com/ and other sections were rebuilt using these over 1000 photos of a real J5 as reference. Theyre available from https://mega.co.nz/#!X5RDAB5Z!dHPZhCxojt_RATuMAIWiNlLeWANaALRtqvDHPFsv-MA

Thomas Otto has also done some great work cleaning up and enhancing various parts of the model.

Im using 3dsmax but anything that can import and export obj files would work to update.

Using a lot of lego for most points of articulation, the current set is

10x 18654
2x 2460
1x 64276
1x 32174
5x 11090
5x 23443
2x 47455
2x 62462
2x 3673 or 2780 (friction version keeps arms/shoulders in place. Just buy a number of both types and experiment)

Use bricklink for these, the cost is minimal. Buy extras too.

Using so much lego also makes it very modular, which makes it easier to update parts without affecting other parts of the model. Im also a terrible painter so I can reprint and paint anything I screw up.

A quick guide of how the parts go together can be seen here.

This is still a WIP, the base lego hinge isnt great and could be optimised. Theres also ample examples of bad meshes which came from the solid > mesh process that are yet to be repaired.

Making it all fit currently requires a lot of dremel and sanding work but it does come together and print nicely.

My current painted version of the model can be seen here.
